## known

Note that for trigger-based (TB) PPDUs, the EHT-SIG isn't present over the
air as all the information for each station is provided in the trigger
frame. Sniffer should - where possible - provide a subset of the OFDMA
related fields to simplify understanding of the resulting capture (i.e. to
be able to read it without having to go back to the prior trigger frame.)

Note: The "RU/MRU Size" and "RU/MRU Index" fields are provided for sniffers
that cannot provide the entirety of the RU allocations and user information
fields (which would allow knowing exactly which AID got which RU allocation),
but can only provide a subset of the information. They apply only to the
captured AID. It's advantageous to provide this even when all the RU
Allocaction and User Information fields are known, so the display tool need
not parse all of them.

Some values here could also appear for non-OFDMA PPDUs.

| **`0xc0000000`** | Primary 80 MHz Channel Position (0: lowest, 3: highest in frequency)|

Note: The RU/MRU Size and RU/MRU Index are calculated fields, ideally the
sniffer should provide them for all OFDMA and punctured non-OFDMA PPDUs to
simplify filtering and other data uses.

Note: The Primary 80 MHz channel position is numbered from low frequency to
high frequency. Also note that it is required in order to decode the "RU
Allocation (TB format)" field, since the decoding thereof requires doing the
table lookup from 802.11be Table 9-53b (Lookup table for X1 and N) to have
the correct values for interpretation of 802.11be Table 9-53a (Encoding of
PS160 and RU Allocation subfields in an EHT variant User Info field).

### RU Allocation field order

Together with the "RU Allocation 1" field from data[1], the RU Allocation
fields shall be in the following order:

| RU Allocation                        | 20MHz | 40MHz | 80MHz | 160MHz | 320MHz |
| :---                                 | :---: | :---: | :---: |  :---: |  :---: |

| **`0x00000c00`** | (reserved) |
| **`0x0000f000`** | NSS (EHT sounding) |
| **`0x00010000`** | Beamformed (EHT sounding) |
| **`0x000e0000`** | Number Of Non-OFDMA Users |
| **`0x00f00000`** | User Encoding Block CRC |
| **`0x3f000000`** | User Encoding Block Tail |
| **`0xc0000000`** | (reserved) |

## data[8]

| **bits** | **meaning** |
| **`0x00000001`** | RU Allocation (TB format): PS 160 |
| **`0x00000002`** | RU Allocation (TB format): B0 |
| **`0x000001fc`** | RU Allocation (TB format): B7--B1 |
| **`0xfffffe00`** | (reserved) |

Note: the `0x1ff` bits here indicate the RU Allocation for the captured
station (AID) in the trigger-based (TB) format, per Table 9-53a "Encoding of
PS160 and RU Allocation subfields in an EHT variant User Info field". This
may be given by the sniffer even for downlink OFDMA PPDUs if calculated from
the RU Allocation from EHT-SIG for the given station. Note the bit split to
ease cross-referencing Table 9-53a.

## `user_info` entry

Each `user_info` entry carries information for a given user entry
in the EHT preamble. If multiple user fields are captured, ideally
all of them are, and they should be given in the same order as they
were ordered in the frame.

Note that to simplify parsing we indicate non-MU-MIMO (e.g. OFDMA) and
MU-MIMO information via separate known bits, so that parsers can show
these fields without consulting other information to know the PPDU type.

The "Data captured for this user" bit indicates which user the data was
captured for that this radiotap header is attached to. It should be set
for exactly one `user_info` entry in the entire radiotap header, even if
potentially the entire EHT field is given multiple times.
