The presence of this field indicates that the frame was received or
transmitted using the HE PHY.

This field contains data mostly from the HE-SIG-A part that is common
to all HE transmissions, but some of the data might also be calculated
(e.g. when included in the transmission of an HE_TRIG type frame, some
parameters are not included in the HE-SIG-A but were determined by the
trigger frame).

However, for PPDUs of HE_MU format, it contains the data that applies
to the encoding of the PSDU, with more detailed information about the
MU transmission contained in the [HE-MU](HE-MU) field if needed, in
many cases that field will not be needed as all the data about the
single user that was captured is already encoded here.

In the case of MU transmissions, the [HE-MU-other-user](HE-MU-other-user)
field may also be present one or more times in that case to capture extra
users for which the data couldn't be captured; if the data was captured
for more than one user then multiple packets must be written into the
radiotap capture.

Note that while this table lists all possible *positions*, it doesn't list
all possible *combinations*, i.e. with an HE-MU transmission the RU
allocation may be mixed into different bandwidths for different users.
