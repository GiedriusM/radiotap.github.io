This field contains data from a SIG-B per-user field for those extra
users for which the data may not have been captured. This field isn't
normally necessary; if an HE_MU PPDU was captured then typically only
one of the many users will be captured, in which case all data can be
encoded in the [HE](HE) and [HE-MU](HE-MU) fields.

In case more of the SIG-B could be captured, this field allows having
data data captured in radiotap. It's allowed but not necessary to have
this field also for the user whose data was captured.

Note that the MCS/DCM/etc. configuration for the captured data is
already encoded in the regular [HE](HE) field, and for the SIG-B it's
part of the [HE-MU](HE-MU) field.

The split into parts 1 and 2 allows packing this more densely due to
then requiring alignment of only two.

## per_user_1

| **`0x7fff`** | B0-B14 of the HE-SIG-B user field as in spec |
| **`0x8000`** | (reserved) |

## per_user_2

| **`0x003f`** | B15-B20 of the HE-SIG-B user field as in spec |
| **`0xffc0`** | (reserved) |

## per_user_position

This contains the position of this user field, starting from 0.

## per_user_known

| **`0x01`** | user field position known |
| **`0x02`** | STA-ID known (B0-10) |
| **`0x04`** | NSTS known (B11-13, only for non-MU-MIMO) |
| **`0x08`** | Tx Beamforming known (B14, only for non-MU-MIMO) |
| **`0x10`** | Spatial Configuration known (B11-B14, only for MU-MIMO) |
| **`0x20`** | MCS known (B15-18) |
| **`0x40`** | DCM known (B19) |
| **`0x80`** | Coding known (B20) |
