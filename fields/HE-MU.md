This field contains data related to PPDUs of HE_MU type that wasn't
already captured in the regular [HE](HE) field. This is the common
data (from HE-SIG-A and HE-SIG-B), the per-user data can be captured
in the [HE-MU-other-user](HE-MU-other-user) field.

## Channel 1 / Channel 2 usage and RU byte mapping

The "Channel 1" and "Channel 2" specific fields (respectively "channel1
and channel2" on the RU fields) are used in the following way:

 * Channel 1's known field is always used, use it to indicate how much
   data of channel 1 was captured
 * Channel 2's known field is only used for 40 MHz and higher, use it to
   indicate how much data of channel 2 was captured, it should be set to
   0 (for unknown) for 20 MHz

The RU octets in the arrays ("RU_channel1" and "RU_channel2") represent
the RU allocation index according to Table 28-26 ("RU allocation subfield").

The following tables map the RU fields to tone ranges:

### Channel 1 tones depending on known field

If **known=0**, no data was reported (e.g. HW not capable, or CRC error on one of the SIG-Bs).

If **known=1**, the data is according to the following table, bandwidth
being from the "bandwidth from Bandwidth field in HE-SIG-A" flags 2 field.

| **RU idx** | **bw=0 (20 MHz)** | **bw=1 (40 MHz)** | **bw=2 (80 MHz)** | **bw=3 (160 MHz)** |
| **RU[0]** | -122:122 | -244:-3 | -500:-259 | -1012:-771 |
| **RU[1]** | / | / | 17:258 | -495:-254 |
| **RU[2]** | / | / | / | 12:253 |
| **RU[3]** | / | / | / | 529:770 |
| **Center 26-tone** | / | / | -16:-4, 4:16 | -528:-516, -508:-496 |

### Channel 2 tones depending on known field

If **known=0**, no data was reported (e.g. HW not capable, or CRC error on one of the SIG-Bs).

If **known=1**, the data is according to the following table, bandwidth
being from the "bandwidth from Bandwidth field in HE-SIG-A" flags 2 field.

| **RU idx** | **bw=0 (20 MHz)** | **bw=1 (40 MHz)** | **bw=2 (80 MHz)** | **bw=3 (160 MHz)** |
